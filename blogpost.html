        <h1>The Hevan For Blogger</h1>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1]
            Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat,
            sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
            naturally occurring contaminants.</p><br>

        <p> Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that
            the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as
            manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is
            often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory or mine)
            or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or
            agricultural runoff).</p><br>

        <p>Many sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries
            until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century.
            Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long
            after the source of the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light
            pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination,
            thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.</p><br>

        <p> Pollution has widespread consequences on human and environmental health, having systematic impact on social
            and economic systems. In 2019, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths), a number
            unchanged since 2015.[2][3][4] Air pollution accounted for 3⁄4 of these earlier deaths.[5][6] A 2022
            literature review found that levels of anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries
            and now threaten entire ecosystems around the world.[7][8] Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on
            vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, and marginalized communities, because polluting
            industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with populations with less economic and political
            power.[9] This outsized impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice
            movement,[10][11] and continues to be a core element of environmental conflicts, particularly in the Global
            South.</p><br>

        <p>Because of the impacts of these chemicals, local, country and international policy have increasingly sought
            to regulate pollutants, resulting in increasing air and water quality standards, alongside regulation of
            specific waste streams. Regional and national policy is typically supervised by environmental agencies or
            ministries, while international efforts are coordinated by the UN Environmental Program and other treaty
            bodies. Pollution mitigation is an important part of all of the Sustainable Development Goals.[12]</p>
